 * <p>A KeyChain is a class that stores a collection of keys for a Wallet. Key chains are expected

 * request for a given purpose.</p>
 *
 * <p>However it is important to understand what this interface does <i>not</i> provide. It cannot
 * have keys imported into it, that you to use a method of a specific key chain instance, such as
 * {@link BasicKeyChain}. The reason for these restrictions is to support key chains that may be
 * handled by external hardware or software, or which are derived deterministically from a seed (and
 * thus the notion of importing a key is meaningless).</p>
