### Welcome to oceanj

The oceanj library is a Java implementation of the Ocean protocol, which allows it to maintain a wallet and send/receive transactions without having a full node. It builds upon the work of creators of bitcoinj and extends the code to support the unique Ocean blocks and transactions.
